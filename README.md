### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Drake from the United States, and I do Coding and Programming. I enjoy learning how to find different ways to make websites, down to the little things, which take more code than you would think. I also enjoy working on my own projects on my own time. On top of that, I also like doing group projects, it's always nice to have a fresh perspective on things.
