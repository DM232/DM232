### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm DM from the United States, and I do Coding and Programming. I enjoy learning how to find different ways to make websites, even down to the smaller details, which take more code than you would think, and I also enjoy working on my own projects on my own time. On top of that, I also like doing group projects, it's always find it nice to have a fresh perspective on things.
