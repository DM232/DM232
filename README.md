### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, DM232
#### Coding and Programming

I'm Drake from the U.S., and I do Coding and Programming. I enjoy learning how to find different ways to make websites, down to the little things, which take more code than you would think. I also enjoy working on my own projects on my own time. On top of that, I also like doing group projects, it's always nice to have a fresh perspective on things.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
